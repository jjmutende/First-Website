	<p>In 1986 South Boston, young Colin Sullivan is introduced to crime by Irish Mob boss Frank Costello. Twenty years later, Costello has groomed Sullivan as a mole inside the Massachusetts State Police. Sullivan is accepted into its Special Investigations Unit, led by Captain Ellerby. Another recruit, Billy Costigan Jr., is approached by Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam and given the choice of being kicked out based on family ties to crime or to go undercover and infiltrate Costello's crew. They set up a cover for him as an academy dropout, and he serves time in jail on a phony battery charge and joins Costello's crew. Ellerby informs Special Investigations that only Queenan and Dignam will know their operatives' names for safety's sake and that Costello's crew has stolen computer microprocessors to sell to a Chinese gang representing the Chinese government. As Costigan is accepted as a member of Costello's crew, his emotional state declines. Queenan and Dignam tell him there is a rat in the Special Investigations Unit and plead with him to stay until the deal takes place.</p><p>Sullivan begins a romance with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden. Costigan sees her professionally as part of his probation. The MSP is ready to catch Costello selling the microprocessors, but the deal takes place off-camera, and everyone escapes, enraging Ellerby. Costello realizes there is a rat. Sullivan is promoted and tasked by Costello to find the rat. Sullivan tells him to deliver information about his crew members to cross-reference them in the MSP database. Costigan learns that Costello is an FBI informant. Costello accuses Costigan of being the rat, but Costigan denies it. He tells Queenan that Costello is an FBI informant and is aware of a mole in his crew.</p><p>Costigan follows Costello into a theater, witnessing Costello give Sullivan an envelope. Queenan gives Costigan instructions to get a visual ID of Sullivan before making the arrest. Costigan chases him but is unable to see his face. When Costigan's phone rings, Sullivan realizes he's being followed and prepares to stab Costigan, but kills a random person by accident and escapes. He realizes he and Costigan have been captured on a security camera and tries cross-referencing officers but cannot recognize Costigan on the footage.</p><p>Sullivan meets with Queenan and is advised to follow Costello to find his rat. Costello waits for Sullivan to find the rat and tells Costigan to take the day off. Costigan calls Queenan to meet. Sullivan has Queenan tailed to the meeting. When Costello's men arrive, Queenan helps Costigan escape before confronting them and is thrown to his death. Sullivan's officers mortally wound crew member Delahunt in a gunfight. Costello's gang throws away his dead body. After it is recovered, the news states that he had been an undercover cop. Angered by Queenan's murder, Dignam attacks Sullivan and resigns. Sullivan learns that Costello is an FBI informant. Sullivan helps the MSP catch Costello, and with Costigan's help, Costello is tailed to a cocaine drop-off, where a gunfight erupts. Most of the crew are killed. Sullivan confronts Costello, who admits he is an informant. When he draws a gun, Sullivan fatally shoots him.</p><p>The operation done, Costigan goes to Sullivan to reveal his undercover status. Noticing Costello's envelope on Sullivan's desk and realizing that Sullivan was the rat inside the police, he flees. Sullivan erases Costigan's records from police computers. Costigan hands Madden an envelope, instructing her to open it if something happens to him. Madden has moved in with Sullivan and informs him she is pregnant. Madden finds a letter addressed to Sullivan from Costigan. She opens the letter, which contains tapes Costello made of himself with Sullivan. Madden listens to them and leaves Sullivan.</p><p>Costigan arranges to meet Sullivan on the rooftop where Queenan died, then arrests him. Costigan called Trooper Brown, a friend of his from the academy, to substantiate his identity, but Brown pulls a gun on Costigan when he arrives, unsure who is telling the truth. Costigan says he has evidence tying Sullivan to Costello, and Brown lets him go down the elevator. Reaching the lobby, Costigan and Brown are killed by Trooper Barrigan, who then reveals himself to be another mole working for Costello. Sullivan shoots Barrigan. At Costigan's funeral, Sullivan notices Madden. He tries to speak with her about their child, but she ignores him. Sullivan arrives at his apartment, where Dignam, having found out about him, is waiting. Sullivan quickly accepts his fate before Dignam shoots him in the head. As Dignam exits, the camera pans to a rat crawling across the balcony and disappearing, and the audience is left to wonder whether Dignam was avenging Queenan and Costigan or whether he was just another mole working at the behest of the mob.</p>
