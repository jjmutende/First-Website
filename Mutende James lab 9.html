	<h1>The Departed</h1>
	<p>In 1986 South Boston, young Colin Sullivan is introduced to crime by Irish Mob boss Frank Costello. Twenty years later, Costello has groomed Sullivan as a mole inside the Massachusetts State Police. Sullivan is accepted into its Special Investigations Unit, led by Captain Ellerby. Another recruit, Billy Costigan Jr., is approached by Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam and given the choice of being kicked out based on family ties to crime or to go undercover and infiltrate Costello's crew. They set up a cover for him as an academy dropout, and he serves time in jail on a phony battery charge and joins Costello's crew. Ellerby informs Special Investigations that only Queenan and Dignam will know their operatives' names for safety's sake and that Costello's crew has stolen computer microprocessors to sell to a Chinese gang representing the Chinese government. As Costigan is accepted as a member of Costello's crew, his emotional state declines. Queenan and Dignam tell him there is a rat in the Special Investigations Unit and plead with him to stay until the deal takes place.</p><p>Sullivan begins a romance with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden. Costigan sees her professionally as part of his probation. The MSP is ready to catch Costello selling the microprocessors, but the deal takes place off-camera, and everyone escapes, enraging Ellerby. Costello realizes there is a rat. Sullivan is promoted and tasked by Costello to find the rat. Sullivan tells him to deliver information about his crew members to cross-reference them in the MSP database. Costigan learns that Costello is an FBI informant. Costello accuses Costigan of being the rat, but Costigan denies it. He tells Queenan that Costello is an FBI informant and is aware of a mole in his crew.</p><p>Costigan follows Costello into a theater, witnessing Costello give Sullivan an envelope. Queenan gives Costigan instructions to get a visual ID of Sullivan before making the arrest. Costigan chases him but is unable to see his face. When Costigan's phone rings, Sullivan realizes he's being followed and prepares to stab Costigan, but kills a random person by accident and escapes. He realizes he and Costigan have been captured on a security camera and tries cross-referencing officers but cannot recognize Costigan on the footage.</p><p>Sullivan meets with Queenan and is advised to follow Costello to find his rat. Costello waits for Sullivan to find the rat and tells Costigan to take the day off. Costigan calls Queenan to meet. Sullivan has Queenan tailed to the meeting. When Costello's men arrive, Queenan helps Costigan escape before confronting them and is thrown to his death. Sullivan's officers mortally wound crew member Delahunt in a gunfight. Costello's gang throws away his dead body. After it is recovered, the news states that he had been an undercover cop. Angered by Queenan's murder, Dignam attacks Sullivan and resigns. Sullivan learns that Costello is an FBI informant. Sullivan helps the MSP catch Costello, and with Costigan's help, Costello is tailed to a cocaine drop-off, where a gunfight erupts. Most of the crew are killed. Sullivan confronts Costello, who admits he is an informant. When he draws a gun, Sullivan fatally shoots him.</p><p>The operation done, Costigan goes to Sullivan to reveal his undercover status. Noticing Costello's envelope on Sullivan's desk and realizing that Sullivan was the rat inside the police, he flees. Sullivan erases Costigan's records from police computers. Costigan hands Madden an envelope, instructing her to open it if something happens to him. Madden has moved in with Sullivan and informs him she is pregnant. Madden finds a letter addressed to Sullivan from Costigan. She opens the letter, which contains tapes Costello made of himself with Sullivan. Madden listens to them and leaves Sullivan.</p><p>Costigan arranges to meet Sullivan on the rooftop where Queenan died, then arrests him. Costigan called Trooper Brown, a friend of his from the academy, to substantiate his identity, but Brown pulls a gun on Costigan when he arrives, unsure who is telling the truth. Costigan says he has evidence tying Sullivan to Costello, and Brown lets him go down the elevator. Reaching the lobby, Costigan and Brown are killed by Trooper Barrigan, who then reveals himself to be another mole working for Costello. Sullivan shoots Barrigan. At Costigan's funeral, Sullivan notices Madden. He tries to speak with her about their child, but she ignores him. Sullivan arrives at his apartment, where Dignam, having found out about him, is waiting. Sullivan quickly accepts his fate before Dignam shoots him in the head. As Dignam exits, the camera pans to a rat crawling across the balcony and disappearing, and the audience is left to wonder whether Dignam was avenging Queenan and Costigan or whether he was just another mole working at the behest of the mob.</p>
	<h1>The Wolf of Wallstreet</h1>
	<p>In 1987, Jordan Belfort lands a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna. He is quickly enticed into the sex and drug-fueled stockbroker culture and passes on his idea that a broker's only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan loses his job following Black Monday, the largest one-day stock market drop in history, and takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.</p><p>Jordan befriends his neighbor Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company. They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the "hard sell." Jordan's tactics and salesmanship largely contribute to the success of his pump and dump scheme, which involves inflating the price of a stock through issuing misleading, positive statements in order to sell it at an artificially augmented price. When the perpetrators of the scheme sell their overvalued securities, the price drops immensely and those who were conned into buying at the inflated price are left with stock that is suddenly worth a lot less than what they paid. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name Stratton Oakmont in 1989.</p><p>After an expos√© in Forbes, hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia; when his wife finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi in 1991. Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont.</p><p>In 1993, Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the IPO of Steve Madden. This brings him and his firm further to the attention of the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma, who is a British national and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.</p><p>Donnie and Brad get into a public brawl; Donnie escapes, but Brad is arrested. Brad does not say a word about Donnie or Jordan to the police. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan's father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech. In 1996, Jordan, Donnie and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship capsizes in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine; Jordan takes this as a sign from God and decides to sober up.</p><p>Two years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has informed the FBI on Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. At home, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their daughter and infant son; in an impulsive, cocaine-fueled rage, Jordan tries to drive away with his daughter and crashes his car in the driveway. Later on, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie, warning him. The FBI discovers this, arrests Jordan, and raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite breaching his deal, Jordan receives a reduced sentence of 36 months in a minimum security prison for his testimony and is released after serving 22 months. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique.</p>
	<h1>Shutter Island</h1>
	<p>In 1954, U.S. Marshals Edward "Teddy" Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island in Boston Harbor. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: "The law of 4; who is 67?". The two men arrive just before a massive storm, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days.</p><p>Teddy and Chuck find the staff confrontational. Lead psychiatrist John Cawley refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor Lester Sheehan left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. They are told that Ward C, one of three, is reserved for the most severely disturbed patients and is off limits, along with the lighthouse, which has already been searched. While being interviewed, one patient writes the word "RUN" in Teddy's notepad. Teddy starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and has waking visions of his experiences as a U.S. Army soldier during the liberation of Dachau including reprisals against the guards. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by arsonist Andrew Laeddis. In one instance, she tells Teddy that Solando is still on the island‚Äîas is Laeddis, who everyone claims was never there. Teddy later explains to Chuck that locating Laeddis was his ulterior motive for taking the case.</p><p>Teddy and Chuck find Solando has resurfaced with no explanation, prompting the former to break into the restricted Ward C. Teddy encounters George Noyce, a patient in solitary confinement, who claims that the doctors are experimenting on patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be lobotomized. Noyce warns that everyone else on the island, including Chuck, is playing an elaborate game designed for Teddy.</p><p>Teddy regroups with Chuck and climbs the cliffs toward the lighthouse. They become separated, and Teddy later sees what he believes to be Chuck's body on the rocks below. By the time he climbs down, the body has disappeared, but he finds a cave where he discovers a woman in hiding, who claims to be the real Rachel Solando. She states that she is a former psychiatrist at the hospital who discovered the experiments with psychotropic medication and trans-orbital lobotomy in an attempt to develop mind control techniques. Before she could report her findings to the authorities, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe as a patient. Teddy returns to the hospital, but finds no evidence of Chuck ever being there.</p><p>Convinced Chuck was taken to the lighthouse, Teddy breaks in, only to discover Cawley waiting for him. Cawley explains that Teddy is actually Andrew Laeddis, their "most dangerous patient", incarcerated in Ward C for murdering his manic depressive wife, Dolores, after she drowned their children. Edward Daniels and Rachel Solando are anagrams of Andrew Laeddis and Dolores Chanal, and the little girl from Laeddis's recurring dreams is his daughter Rachel. Cawley disclosed it was Andrew who attacked Noyce two weeks earlier for calling him Laeddis. According to Cawley, the events of the past several days have been designed to break Andrew's conspiracy-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of Teddy Daniels. The hospital staff were part of the test, including Lester Sheehan posing as Chuck Aule and a nurse posing as Rachel Solando. Andrew's migraines were withdrawal symptoms from his medication, as were his hallucinations of the "real Rachel Solando." Overwhelmed, Andrew faints.</p><p>He awakens in the hospital under the watch of Cawley, Sheehan, the warden and the nurse who played Rachel Solando. When questioned, he tells the truth in a coherent manner, satisfying the doctors. Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before, but Andrew regressed. He warns this will be Andrew's last chance; otherwise, they will have to lobotomize him.</p><p>Some time later, Andrew relaxes on the hospital grounds with Sheehan, but calls him "Chuck" again, saying they must leave the island because bad things are going on. Sheehan shakes his head to Cawley, to which Cawley says something inaudibly to Naehring and the warden and then turns away. The warden gestures to the orderlies and Andrew is taken away to be lobotomized. Before leaving peacefully, Andrew asks Sheehan if it would be better "to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?" A stunned Sheehan calls Andrew "Teddy" but the latter does not respond to the name. The camera pans to the lighthouse while Andrew is preparing to be lobotomized.</p>
